# README

This is my Python implementation for Insight [Digital-wallet challenge](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/digital-wallet).


## Environment:
- MacOS Sierra (10.12.1)
- Python 2.7.12

## To run:
```
sh ./run.sh
```

~~Batch_payment.csv and Stream_payment.csv are downloaded in the [paymo_input](https://github.com/fengsterooni/Insight-Challenge/paymo_input/) directory for testing.~~

Please follow the links in [batch_payment.txt](https://github.com/fengsterooni/Insight-Challenge/paymo_input/batch_payment.txt) and [stream_payment.txt](https://github.com/fengsterooni/Insight-Challenge/paymo_input/stream_payment.txt) to download the data files (batch_payment.csv and stream_payment.csv) to your [paymo_input](https://github.com/fengsterooni/Insight-Challenge/paymo_input/) directory for testing. Can not upload them because of the file size limitation for Github.

The detection results shall be generated in [paymo_output](https://github.com/fengsterooni/Insight-Challenge/paymo_output/) directory. Check the results for running the downloaded data files.

Check [results.txt](https://github.com/fengsterooni/challenge/results.txt) for a sample terminal output.
